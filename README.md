# Hi there, I'm Ravi Lalwani! 👋

I'm a **Quality Automation Engineer** with 4.8 years of experience in **web, mobile, and API automation**. I’m passionate about building reliable and scalable test automation frameworks and working with the latest technologies to ensure the best quality code.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- 🌱 Currently working with **Playwright** and **TypeScript** while honing my skills in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** to improve the quality of my code.
- 🔧 Building and optimizing **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions** to streamline test automation.

### 💻 Skills & Expertise
- **Web Automation**: Selenium with Java, C#
- **Mobile Automation**: Appium with Java, C#
- **API Automation**: HTTP C# Client
- **Frameworks**: TestNG (Java), MSTest (C#)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

I take pride in creating robust automation solutions, and I'm always excited to learn and apply new technologies to improve software quality.

### 🌟 Featured Project
**[Selenium-TestNG-Elite-Framework](https://github.com/Ravi007-rl/Selenium-TestNG-Elite-Framework.git)**  
This is a Selenium-based automation framework built using **Java** and **TestNG**. The goal of this project is to provide a flexible and reusable framework that simplifies test automation for others. If you are new to automation, this framework can give you a solid understanding of how to create your own.

### 🤝 Collaboration
I haven't had the chance to collaborate on any open-source projects yet, but I'm always open to new opportunities to work with like-minded individuals on impactful projects.
